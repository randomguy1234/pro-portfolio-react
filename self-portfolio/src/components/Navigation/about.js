            <p>
                I had a love for technology ever since I was a kid. Fast forward to 
                the beginning of college and I was exposed to programming for the 
                first time in my life. Now I have a degree in computer science and 
                have acquired some experience with various technologies. I am excited
                about what I will build next.
